deprecations:
  - |
    Ceilometer's API is deprecated in Ocata. Therefore, threshold alarms are
    now deprecated as well. Threshold rules will be removed when Ceilometer's
    API is also removed. Similar functionality is provided through Gnocchi
    alarm rules: ``gnocchi_resources_threshold``,
    ``gnocchi_aggregation_by_metrics_threshold``, or
    ``gnocchi_aggregation_by_resources_threshold``.
