    Gnocchi aggregation capabilities are now cached to minimise redundant calls
    to Gnocchi when validating aggregation methods. The cache is stored
    in-memory for an hour. If additional aggregations are added to Gnocchi,
    they will not be proprogated to Aodh's API service for at most an hour or
    unless the service is restarted.
