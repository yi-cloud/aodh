    When an unprivileged user want to access to Gnocchi resources created by
    Ceilometer, that doesn't work because the filter scope the Gnocchi query to
    resource owner to the user. To fix we introduce a new configuration option
    "gnocchi_external_project_owner" set by default to "service". The new
    filter now allow two kind of Gnocchi resources:

    * owned by the user project
    * owned by "gnocchi_external_project_owner" and the original project_id of
      the resource is the user project.
